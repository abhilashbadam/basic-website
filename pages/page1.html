        <p>ANI Technologies Pvt. Ltd., operating under the trade name Ola, is an Indian online transportation network company. It was founded as an online cab aggregator in Mumbai, but is now based in Bangalore. As of September 2015, Ola was valued at $5 billion.[citation needed]

Ola Cabs was founded on 3 December 2010 by Bhavish Aggarwal, currently CEO, and Ankit Bhati. As of 2017, the company has expanded to a network of more than 600,000 vehicles across 110 cities. In November 2014, Ola diversified to incorporate autos on trial basis in Bangalore.[4] Post the trial phase, Ola Auto expanded to other cities like Delhi, Pune, Chennai, Hyderabad and Kolkata starting December 2014. In December 2015, Ola expanded its auto services in Mysore, Chandigarh, Indore, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Guwahati and Visakhapatnam. Ola was valued at $US5 billion as of September 2015.[5]

In March 2015, OlaCabs acquired Bangalore based taxi service TaxiForSure for about $US200 million.[6] From the 25th of June 2015, Ola users have gained access to TFS cabs via the Ola mobile application.[7] By November 2015, Ola had acquired Geotagg, a trip-planning applications company, for an undisclosed sum to strengthen its new bus-shuttle service.[8]

Ola provides different types of service, ranging from economic to luxury travel.[9] The cabs are reserved through a mobile app and the service accepts both cash and cashless payments with Ola money.[10] It claims to clock an average of more than 150,000 bookings per day and commands 60% of the market share in India.[11] November 2014 Ola also started on-demand auto rickshaw service on its mobile app in Bangalore, Pune and now available in 73 cities.[citation needed]

Taxi-hailing app Ola has raised USD1.1 billion in a new round of funding in october 2017 led by China's Tencent Holdings and existing investor Japan's SoftBank Group, and claimed to be in advanced talks to raise another $1 billion from other investors. The taxi aggregator did not reveal the valuation at which it raised the latest round of funding. The money comes as a booster shot for the homegrown startup to keep up its intense competition with American rival Uber as both firms are burning millions of dollars every day in incentives and discounts for India's $12 billion taxi market. Ola will use the funds to increase the number of its drivers and expand its presence to more cities, it said in a statement on Wednesday. It also plans to make significant technology investments into artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities The Bengaluru-based firm, which has a majority market share, is present in 110 cities through bike, auto-rickshaw and electric car offerings.[12]</p>
